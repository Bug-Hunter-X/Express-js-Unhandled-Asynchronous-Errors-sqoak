# Express.js Unhandled Asynchronous Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications: unhandled asynchronous errors within route handlers.  Improperly handling these errors can lead to silent failures, making debugging significantly more complex.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where a potential error in an asynchronous operation isn't properly handled, leading to a lack of informative responses to the client.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any are added in future updates).
4. Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` for the corrected code).
5. Observe the console output and the application's behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves properly propagating the errors using a centralized error handler or by handling errors explicitly in each route handler.  This ensures that errors are communicated effectively to the client, aiding in easier debugging and better user experience.
